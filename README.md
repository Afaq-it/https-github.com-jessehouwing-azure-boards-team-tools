# Project Description

Community TFS Team Tools is a community project based on the example code from ALM Rangers - [Quick Response Sample Command line utility to manage TFS Teams](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/quick-response-sample-command-line-utility-to-manage-team-foundation-server-teams-and-users/). 

It was put on-hold and since then Jesse Houwing has adopted it and taken it under his wings.
